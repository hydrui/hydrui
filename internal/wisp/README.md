This is a quick'n'dirty Go implementation of Wisp, a WebSocket-based multiplexing proxy protocol. It is based on version 1.2 of the [original specification](https://github.com/MercuryWorkshop/wisp-protocol), and does not implement the epoxy-tls extensions.

Please do due diligence of your own before using this in production. :)
